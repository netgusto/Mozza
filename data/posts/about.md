Stuffed with Markdown flavoured **Mozza**.

At Net Gusto, we love [**Markdown**](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), so much even that we placed it at the center of our work processes. We like it's *simplicity*, its *readability*, its *universalism*.

When we write a document, we write it with Markdown.

Same goes with blog posts, why not ? So we needed a simple tool that would allow us to publish blog posts simply by creating a Markdown document.

## Delicious Mozza

Enters [**Mozza**](http://github.com/netgusto/Mozza), the deliciously simple blog engine that runs on **Markdown**, developped by the skilled craftsmen at Net Gusto.

Mozza is based on [**Silex**](http://silex.sensiolabs.org), the PHP micro-framework using Symfony2 components. Mozza is designed to be an ascetic solution to online post publication, rather than a do-it-all piece of software.

Should you want to use it for yourself, you may download it from [**GitHub**](http://github.com/netgusto/Mozza) (open-source MIT Licence).

If you're into Markdown, you may also like [**upndown**](http://upndown.netgusto.com/), the HTML to Markdown converter.
